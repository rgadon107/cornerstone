//Render each member's role

//Render each member's name (post_title)
//If that's the case, do we really need the name in the post_meta?
//No, we don't b/c we can order 'members' posts by menu order.

//Render each member's bio (the_content)

//Render the number of tours this member has participated in (include the current tour)
