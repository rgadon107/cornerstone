# Extend GiveWP

This plugin extends the Give donation plugin by registering custom functions to it's hooks (actions and filters). 
It's structure is modeled on the <a href="https://github.com/KnowTheCode/Sandbox-Workspace">`Sandbox-Workspace` plugin</a> 
available from <a href="https://knowthecode.io/">KnowTheCode.</a>  

The plugin is currently in use on the <a href="https://cornerstonechorale.org>"Cornerstone Chorale & Brass website.</a>
It's also under version control in the <a href="https://github.com/rgadon107/cornerstone">`cornerstone`</a> repository on 
Github.com.
