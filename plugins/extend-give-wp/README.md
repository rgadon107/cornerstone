# Extend GiveWP

## Purpose

This plugin extends the <a href="givewp.com">GiveWP donation plugin</a> by: 

(1) registering custom functions to it's actions hooks, 
(2) setting an option in the WordPress database to store and retrieve the featured image post ID displayed in the Give donation form, and
(3) registering `extend-give-wp` with the Custom module of the `central-hub` plugin to to flush the rewrite rules on plugin status change (activation, deactivation, uninstall);

This plugin's structure is modeled on the <a href="https://github.com/KnowTheCode/Sandbox-Workspace">`Sandbox-Workspace` plugin,</a> 
which is also available from the <a href="https://github.com/KnowTheCode">KnowtheCode.io code repository on GitHub.com</a>.

## Application

The plugin is currently in use on the <a href="https://cornerstonechorale.org">Cornerstone Chorale & Brass website.</a>
It's also under version control in the <a href="https://github.com/rgadon107/extend-give-wp">`'extend-give-wp'`</a> repository on 
Github.com.
