# Extend GiveWP

## Purpose

This plugin extends the <a href="givewp.com">GiveWP donation plugin</a> by (1) registering custom functions to it's hooks (actions and filters), and 
(2) settings an option in the WordPress database to store and retrieve the donation form featured image post ID. 

The plugin structure is modeled on the <a href="https://github.com/KnowTheCode/Sandbox-Workspace">`Sandbox-Workspace` plugin</a> 
available from the <a href="https://github.com/KnowTheCode">KnowtheCode.io code repository on GitHub.com</a>.

## Application

The plugin is currently in use on the <a href="https://cornerstonechorale.org">Cornerstone Chorale & Brass website.</a>
It's also under version control in the <a href="https://github.com/rgadon107/extend-give-wp">`'extend-give-wp'`</a> repository on 
Github.com.
