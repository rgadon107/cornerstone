# Extend GiveWP

This plugin extends the Give donation plugin by registering custom functions to it's hooks (actions and filters). 
It's structure is modeled on the <a href="https://github.com/KnowTheCode/Sandbox-Workspace">`Sandbox-Workspace` plugin</a> 
available from <a href="https://knowthecode.io/">KnowTheCode.</a>  The plugin is currently saved in the remote repository
for the <a href="https://github.com/rgadon107/cornerstone">Cornerstone Chorale & Brass on GitHub.com</a>.
